  :project notes:
  the objective is simulate the kind of natural selection experienced by the speckled moths during the industrial revolution.
  main objects
  moths:
    little circles of a randomly selected color which can be clicked on to remove from play.
  a field which is a solid color:
    the field mimics the environment of creatures to hide in.
  behaviors:
    == A moth has a velocity which will update it's position. Every time interval T the moths speed and direction will be randomly reassigned.
    == a moth, on click, will "die" and to speed things along, every moth nearby it in color space also has a chance of dieing. This will probably be a gaussian distribution.
    == dead moths will be logged for data analysis purposes.
    == the field will have N moths
    == when the field has N-D moths, D pairs of moths will be chosen at random and their color will averaged together with a bit of fudge-factor introduced to represent sexual reproduction and mutation.

  program flow:
    1. initialize field with size parameter(L), population parameter(N), mutation parameter(MUT), click spread parameter(SPRD) √
    2. generate linear distribution of moths with event handle B (ehB)
    3. begin time loop A(tlA)
    tlA.1. choose a random velocity
    tlA.2. start time loop B
      tlB.1 increment moth position by velocity
      tlB.2 check for boundary crossing
        if out of bounds, richochet
    ehB.t (triggers on click of moth div)
    ehB.1 fetches color vector of clicked moth. targetColor
    ehB.2 iterates over each moth giving them a percent of dieing equal to e^([targetColor-self.color]^2/[SPRD]^2)√
    ehB.3 Math.Random generates a survival score, if survival score exceeds chance of death, they survive, else, die.√
    ehB.4 run repopulate method on field object √
