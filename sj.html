    :project notes:
      objective: alleviate tragedy of the commons break down in social living spaces.
      format: a check list that generates each week a set of tasks to be done for various common areas around the house.
      design parameters:
        periodicity: a 4 week cycle is co-prime with 3 people, so any particularly heavy week for a room eventually gets done by everyone.
        rotations: moving people between rooms so any differences in room difficulty is distributed.
      spaces object:
        contains information about each space and what kind of tasks to do, and how often to do them.
    :flow:
      read current date and calculate time since week 0 (weekNum)
      read spaces object and generate proper table
        mvp:
          all tables have same off set, tasks generated by weekNum%4 = cycleNum
          residents assigned via weekNum%3 = resNum
          spaceTasks(cycleNum, resNum)
        stretch:
          double check that spacing keeps task list relatively evenly spaced.
      render table
        5 columns for spaces
        3 rows, maybe for previous, present, next
        each cell is given a name(which is colored for ease of reading), and collection of tasks
          tasks can be clicked on in some capacity to reveal details
