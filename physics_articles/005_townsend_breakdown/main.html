      How do plasmas form between conductors? This is one of the simpler ways to approach phase transitions. We're going to talk about the Townsend discharge model of plasma formation. The model presumes we have a two parallel plates with a gas between them and we can fiddle with the voltage between the two plates. I'm going to build up a qualitative representation of the model throughout using cellular automata and we'll add elements to it as we go. So first our initial set up.

      No knobs to turn yet, just the empty grid with two borders in gray to represent metal. Blue cells indicate electron density and red cells ion density. Keep in mind that many of these processes are often referred to as "avalanches" because they undergo a rapid transition after a threshold is reached, when you get controls, play around with them slowly to see how tiny changes can have large effects.

      We'll use a periodic boundary condition along the y-axis (go past the top of the screen, come back up the bottom.) So we have two conductors separated by gas, but because the universe is just chock full of enormous thermo nuclear infernos (called stars, by some) these plates are being bombarded by a steady stream of radiation (like everyone is). This produces some electrons near the plates that will drift back into them if there's no voltage, or drift from negative to positive if there is.

            <li>
              <input type='range' name='voltage' value='0'></input> voltage <span class='voltage_display'></span>

      As you can see, more voltage, electrons drift faster, but there aren't really more of them, and plasmas are well known for their mobs and mobs of electrons. That's because we've been neglecting the fact that an electron that's moving fast enough can ionize an atom just as well as a cosmic ray. We're going to model our gases likelihood for ionizing with the coefficient
      $&\alpha&$, higher $&\alpha&$ means the gas has a lower ionization energy, like trying to get a sofa up the front steps is more likely to happen than carrying it up to the third floor. In that example, the first floor sofa has a very high $&\alpha&$, and the third floor sofa has a very a low $&\alpha&$. Play around with $&\alpha&$ on this next example

        <canvas></canvas>
        <form class='controls'>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <input type='range' name='voltage' value='0'></input> voltage <span class='voltage_display'></span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <input type='range' name='alpha' value='0'></input> $&\alpha&$ <span class='alpha_display'></span>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </form>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now some people might be noticing something odd at higher $&\alpha&$ values, We start to get color changes, red starts dominating on the left as deeper blues and purples color the right. This is because whenever you knock an electron off of a gas atom, you also generate an ion to go with it. However, ions, having an opposite charge, move in the opposite direction of electrons, so they congregate to the left. For simplicity we're having the ions move as fast as electrons, which is ludicrous, but it's a qualitative description we're going for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Important thing to think about is how do the ions interact with the metal plate when they get to the cathode (negative electrode). Depending on how loosely held together the metal is, how tightly it holds onto it's own electrons, the ions may actually knock off an electron as it hits the plate. This is where the avalanche takes off and becomes self sustaining. When enough ions hit the cathode to replace the electrons that spawned the ions, this is when we've got a stable state plasma. We describe this likely hood for an ion to knock an electron loose with $&\gamma&$. The full breakdown is shown here when the chamber has a uniform rich purple color.

      During this whole conversation we've been neglecting pressure and how the concentration of the neutral gas impacts the plasma formation process. This is one of the several strengths of approaching the question from a more rigorous analytical approach. It's much easier to answer questions like what is the minimum voltage for breakdown, just how do $&alpha&$ and $&gamma&$ impact that threshold, how does pressure impact that threshold? This numerical simulation wouldn't show that as pressure goes to zero, the breakdown voltage goes to infinity. This doesn't quite bare out in experiment though, what happens is instead of the gas becoming plasma, the electrodes begin contributing atoms to the plasma.
