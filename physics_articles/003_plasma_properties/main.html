      Plasmas being significantly comprised of charged particles have an interesting feature, namely that they are heavily affected by electromagnetic fields. This means that regions of plasma can distribute energy and impact other regions of plasma without using the typical method of collisions. For example when you start using a space heater in a room, part of how the heat gets distributed throughout is by the collision of gas particles. But with plasmas, how important are these field effects and how important are particle-particle collision effects? We're going to talk about density and temperature a bit first, then get into how they impact the rate at which different effects take place.
    </p>
    <h3>Getting down to basics.</h3>
    <p>

       $&n&$
        is the density of particles, however since you typically have at the very least two different kinds of particles, some negative species (often electrons) and some positive species (atomic ions, like hydrogen or helium), in most mathematical treatments you break up the density into how much of each species you have
       $&n_s&$
        so if you have say, an equal distribution of hydrogen and helium and electrons all hot enough to be stripped of all their electrons and uniformly distributed through out, you would have
       $&n_0=n_H=n_{He}=\frac{1}{3}n_e&$
       . Density is measured in quantity per unit volume, such as cubic meters, cubic centimeters, or cubic light years.
    </p>
    <p>

      $&\tau&$
       is the temperature of the system. In many disciplines, temperatures are talked about in units Kelvin, or maybe Celsius, or heaven forbid Rankine. Then when they want to do actual math with them they multiply them by Boltzmann's constant to turn them into some unit of energy, like Joules or Ergs or electron Volts (eV). This is because that's what temperature is, it's an aggregate kinetic energy, a system with twice the temperature will have particles that, on average, have twice the kinetic energy. This also means that
      $&\tau&$
       and
      $&mv^2&$
       can be swapped back and forth with some care and things will stay consistent. Now, physicists, being people, are incredibly lazy, and whenever presented with the choice will write less. So instead of writing
      $&k_b*T&$
       over and over again, we just write
      $&\tau&$
      . <em>This almost never gets confusing when we also use
      $&\tau&$
       as a way to denote time.</em> Another reason for using energies instead of temperatures in plasmas is because they get hot enough that the temperatures tend to be quite large. Since we're dealing with ionized gases, the natural temperature scale is on the order of 1 to 10 eV, because that's how much energy it takes to strip an electron from an atom. 1 eV is over ten thousand Kelvin. While we can still do math on big numbers as thoroughly as we can on small numbers, it is harder to keep in mind relative scale the larger things get. Trying to keep things simple is important, especially when things get intrinsically weirder.
    </p>
    <h3>Plasma Frequency $&\omega_p&$</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most important time scales in a plasma is the plasma frequency. Most plasmas are, when you zoom out and squint, neutral. It's when you get close up that there are variations in that neutrality. The reason for it being over all neutral is because electric fields act over infinite distances if there's a net charge, and it will add roaming charges distinctiveness as part of the plasma whole, their kinetic energy adapted to serve the collective. But internally there are fluctuations that propagate as waves. Like how a pond over all has a level surface, but when you drop a stone in it, ripples form that make a particular region deeper or shallower. Now the same thing happens in plasmas, only instead of depth, it's charge density. These kinds of changes happen on the scale of the plasma frequency which is
      $&\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{n_0e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e}}=\sqrt{k_p n_0}&$
      and is derived from one of the most egregious spherical-cow methods I've had the pleasure of following along so far. It's right up there with assuming stars are cubes to figure out the minimum mass of a black hole, which is a beautiful kind of hilarity in it's own right. The gist of it is we model the plasma as being comprised of two overlapping slabs that interact via electric fields, immobile ions in one slab, light weight electrons in the other. We then pull the electron slab over to the side somewhat so that they no longer fully overlap. Now there's a positive charge density on one side and negative charge density on the other, this causes attraction, restored overlapping and then overshooting, starting the whole process over again. A bit of calculus produces the result that this process has the frequency above, which we elevate to the position of
      $&\omega_p&$
      , it then turns out that this value repeatedly comes up over and over again and it's rather amazing that it can be derived in such a simple way. I've included a little toy below where you can see how frequency changes with density. Density being presented as the opacity of the two slabs. The frequency does change proportionately with density properly, but scaled down considerably slower, typical plasma frequencies are millions or even trillions of cycles per second.

    <h3>Ion Collision Frequency $&\nu_{ei}&$</h3>
    <p>
      So the time scale on which electromagnetic interactions happen is pretty tidy and the derivation was concise. Maybe this whole plasma business isn't so hard after all? next up we have collision frequency
      $&\nu_c&$
      . Well, if we're trying to figure out how often something collides with some set of targets, we think about how big is the target, how many targets are there, and how fast the thing is moving through the targets. Ok, how many is easy, that's just density, particles per volume. How fast the thing is moving through targets is also easy, that's just velocity of our subject, we'll say its an electron for now. so we're at
      $&\nu_c=n_t*v_e*area&$
      , well, how do we calculate area?
    </p>
    <p>
      For a neutral atom, the electron will bounce off it hits it but not really notice otherwise.
    </p>
    <p id='neutral_impact_parameter'>
      <input type='range' id='en_velocity'
        min='10'
        max='27'
        value='20'
      >
      <canvas width=200px height=200px id='neutral_collision_display'></canvas>
      <input type='range' id='en_distance'
        min='0'
        max='200'
        value = '50'
        orient='vertical'
      >
      <input type='button' id='en_start' value = 'run simulation'/>
    </p>
    <p>
      so we end up with something within an order of magnitude of
      $&\pi a_0^2&$
       where
      $&a_0&$
       is the bohr radius, a piddling tiny distance clocking in at about
      $&5*10^{-11}&$
       meters. Which is a really insignificantly tiny number. For context, if all the information in a reasonable quality copy of the film The Shawshank Redemption(700~ megabytes) represented 1 whole meter, the width of an atom is roughly the first bit, the first 1 or 0 of that movie. So, less than a single pixel of a single frame. Unless the electron is almost moving directly at the atom it's going to do nothing at all in response to it's existence. But that's neutral atoms, plasma's are fun because it's the ions and electrons that are doing the cool stuff, how do ions effect the path of an electron?

      Oh dang, you get some pretty wicked redirections going inside that circle, but even never going near it you can see pretty noticeable bending. What's going on here? Well, one useful way to approach this problem is through thinking about potential energy. The same way a bicycle will want to roll down a hill, an electron will want to "roll" down to an ion. The given height of the hill can be either positive or negative depending on if it's opposite or similar charges and goes like
      $&\frac{1}{r}&$
      , so as you get really close, the hill gets incredibly steep. But it never goes quite to zero, even far away. So you can kind of imagine the potential for a charged particle being like the horn of a trombone or cone the flairs out towards the edges. Meanwhile for a neutral particle, a reasonable metaphor would just be a cylinder that goes up forever, nothings getting any closer than the surface of the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying we know what the electron's initial velocity is, we know it's kinetic energy
      $&KE = \frac{m_e}{2}v_e^2&$
      . We could say that the electron has collided with the ion if it would have passed inside a distance that the potential energy is greater than the kinetic energy. The full expression for potential energy between two charged particles is, within a plus or minus sign,
      $&PE= \frac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}&$
      . So when
      $&\frac{PE}{KE}\ge1&$
       we've had a collision. So we'll define a term, radius of collision,
      $&r_c&$
       such that
      $&\frac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r_c} \frac{1}{\frac{m_e}{2}v_e^2}  = 1 &$
       which after a bit of algebra and tidying gives us
      $&r_c = \frac{q^2}{2\pi \epsilon_0 m_e v_e^2} &$ (This is why the circle would change size when you fiddled with horizontal slider bar, you were changing the velocity of the electron.)
      . If this looks complicated, that is because it is much more complicated than the simple constant
      $&a_0&$
       we had for neutral collisions, it's an actual function with dependence on something that might change, the electron velocity. But everything else in that expression is basically a constant, so we could capture all of it's behavior by bundling the rest of the constants together
      $&r_c = \frac{k}{v_e^2} &$
      . This'll make other expressions a bit easier to work with and we'll unpack it later. For a bit of context, if the electron has a kinetic energy of 1 eV (moderately warm, but nothing exceptional), $&r_c&$ would be about a hundred times larger than the bohr radius we talked about earlier. So, we have a radius, area is just radius squared times pi,
      $&A_c = \pi r_c^2 = \frac{\pi k^2}{v_e^4}&$
      . Slap that into our collision frequency expression and we get
      $&\nu_c =n_i v_e \frac{\pi k^2}{v_e^4} = \frac{n_i \pi k^2}{v_e^3}&$.
    </p>
    <h3>Considering $&\frac{\nu}{\omega_p}&$</h3>
    <p>
      So this provides with two different time scales, one on which electrostatic phenomenon take place, and one on which particle-particle phenomenon take place. The resulting ratio is a more rigorous way to ask the question "Yes, these collisions are happening, but are they happening enough to matter?". Collisions cause entropy to increase and are generally the source of a lot of hairiness in describing a plasma with math. Knowing when they can be ignored safely is a nice thing to be able to do. Comparing collision frequency with the plasma frequency is a rigorous way to do this, as they both represent time scales on which things happen. If the collision frequency is much much smaller than the plasma frequency, their ratio is basically 0 and collisions will play a very small part in how the plasma changes. This relationship can be described, ignoring coefficients as
      $&\frac{\nu}{\omega_p}\propto
      \frac{\sqrt{n_0}}{v_e^3}\approx
      \frac{\sqrt{n_0}}{\tau^{3/2}}
      &$
      . We see that high densities and lower temperatures lead to collisional systems. The problem, though, is that if you have a lot of particles in close proximity that aren't very hot, the inter particle forces will encourage it to be a gas, or even a liquid or a solid. This results in most collisional plasmas being found in the centers of stars or on the wave fronts of explosions.
