          Koans are test driven muscle memory exercises that introduce the syntax of a language in a hands on approach. First done with Ruby, many people have made koans for other languages including Javascript. <a href="https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans">mrdavidlain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans">liammclennan</a> both have implemented different sets of koans for Javascript.
