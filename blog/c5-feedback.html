Pairing has been an interesting experience. The hardest part I think is kind of the mismatch in experience. I'm sure my cohort will become very capable programmers, but I kind of jump around with most of my pairing partners. The biggest challenge is verbalizing my intent rather than just putting it into the text. And it's not that I'm not right immediately, like the full source code emerges in my brain within seconds, it's just that the ideas to test, like, 2 or 3 lines of code to put in, run and see how they unfold, I have to slow down that part when I pair actually figure out how to convey those kinds of ideas first. It's really satisfying when I find people to pair with where that exchange is easier. Another satisfying thing is when I can help people understand something we're working on.

The feedback I've been recieving supports the hypothesis that I'm too eager. I need to try and reign in the part of me that wants to solve the problem as quickly as possible. I've been doing that, but it's imperfect wall that leaks. I don't impatience is the emotion that I feel when pairing, just the eagerness to do this solved thing and move onto the next puzzle, but that may be an overly generous interpretation of the self. Even if it isn't though, I could imagine my pairs feel it as impatience, which clearly won't help their performance, so it's expression needs to be regulated.
</p>

<p>
Writing feedback is really hard sometimes. Sometimes there aren't any problems that originate from my pair, others I feel like I have a hard time criticising others when I have such a headstart. What can I say that won't be interpretted as "Why didn't you spend 4 years learning physics and programming before signing up for this?"
