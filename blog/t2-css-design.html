<!-- What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
 -->
  <p>
  Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in the 1600's was the first person to discover the existence of single celled organisms, later on we would discover that these little, seemingly simplest kind of life are also what we're made of. Cells that is. Not prokaryotes, that would be silly. While we are big and complicated, we are made of (comparatively) simple and inarguably (unless you are a physicist) tiny things, heretofore referred to as cells.

  </p>

  <p>
    The cell, (simplified greatly for the purposes of example and mortification of my mother) consists of the nucleus, empty space (queue angry mother), the cell wall, and then more empty space until another cell shows up. Now the particular geometry involved varies a great deal based on what thing those cells are making up, whether it's skin, neuron pathways or intestinal flume rides. But that rough pattern can basically be observed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, after your kind patience I'll get into something I know considerably less about, page elements in an HTML document described by CSS. As I have come to understand it, each element has it's content, it's padding, it's border and it's margin. This happens to match quite closely with my previously described model of the cell. What are the odds?
  </p>

  <p>
    A page element really ought to have content, and from the whole, interaction-centric, object oriented kind of take on thinking, it's basically what matters. So for both the cell and a page element, the nucleus and the content lay in the center, where things are most important. From there we have a barrier that defines inside and outside, this is the cell wall and the border, respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
    But wait! Rarely is the cell wall touching the nucleus, likewise, there is padding between the border of the element, and it's content. More padding means more space between the border and the content. Now, margin is the weakest part of this metaphor, because while the space between cells is usually considered merely extracellular space and not particularly in the domain of one or the other, the margin space around an element is definitely it's own, defining where one starts and the next one ends.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now what does thinking in this way garner us? Well, the geometry of organs is similarly applicable to the geometry of pages. Overall spacing and ordering of elements contributes to how, say, a gallery distinguishes itself from a block of text, or a chat room distinguishes itself from a message board.
