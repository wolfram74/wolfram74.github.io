<!-- 1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
2. What was the source of the conflict?
3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
6. What did you learn from this experience?

<p>
I don't think I do well with conflict. I'm a bit of an idealist, the universe presents problems, people figure out whether they're soluble or not, if so, they work together to fix them. I know the alternative, when pettiness or pride or fear jack the cost of cooperation up too high exists, but still get the kind of feeling that the world has gone askew when it happens. There's a very different kind of thought process that goes on when all parties are unsure of how to go forward and believe they can find one, and when two parties believe they have found ways forward, but they are mutually exclusive or even counter productive of each other.
</p>

<p>
The last social interaction that I think had the confrontational aspect needed to call it a conflict was during the set up phase for a secret santa amongst the group of grad students I'd spent the semester with. There was a first year who had been growing increasingly irritating to me, being condescending, greeting enthusiasm with sarcasm and vulnerability with mockery. Just in general the kind of zero-sum behavior not apropriate for research science. When the secret-pairing went underway not everyone was available because schedules. So about half of the names are unattended. After awhile he starts going around looking at them, making a commotion with each one he reads. The rest of us are asking him to stop in increasingly vocal ways. He eventually stops and then when someone who wasn't there comes in, tricks them into reading his collection of pairs. The end result was that large quantities of the names were re-assigned.
</p>

<p>
The sources of distress I felt were partly rooted in the fact that he was a grad student behaving in manner so utterly unbecoming of a physicist and the mismatch between the things I wanted to do him and the things that would help him learn. I eventually took that energy and did something nice for the other people in the office besides him and let myself interpret that as punishing him. I also on a few instances talked to him in private expressing my misgivings about the way he acted, I don't know how effective it was, but it was what I could do, being a guest in that place.
</p>

<p>
I learned little about resolving conflicts dealing with him. I observed a new kind of callous arrogance in physics, behavior I hadn't had to deal with since junior high. Which makes it all the sadder and frustrating to have to cope with it among graduate students.
