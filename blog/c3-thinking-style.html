  I always have a significant amount of skepticism when taking personality tests. They reek of over aggressive compression. For example, the learning styles test we took has 4 possible outcomes.  This means that tries to compress the entirety of your consciousness, the whole learning, testing counterfactuals, observing reality, process into 2 bits of information. I mean, people who often chafe at the idea of being slotted down into a number will put an awful lot of stock into tests like these or say, the zodiac, which is a little less than 4 bits of information. They are slotting themselves into numbers, and exceptionally tiny ones at that!
  <!-- So, I'm going to blather on about time for a bit. Early on in your physics education, so early that actually a lot of people get to it, you are exposed to the idea of force. Force is the general idea of a thing that makes things change velocity.More force means more change. Simple, right? Only problem is that when you start to do problem, it rapidly becomes a pain in the ass. So much so that the Irish mathematician Hamilton and the French mathematician Lagrange were like "F that noise, let's be lazy about this." and they came up with a way of predicting physical movements using how energy changed with orientation. Like, I have more gravitational energy at the top of a stair case than at the bottom, based on the exact variation in that, they can figure out how I'll fare sky diving. -->

  With this in mind, I'm reflecting on how I felt over these past 2 and a half weeks compared with the result of being slotted into the "abstract sequential" camp. There were 14 statements it makes about AS folk, and by extension me. Of those 14, I'd say 9 apply to me fairly well and how I've felt so far, 4 are too ambiguous to reasonably come down yeah or nay. And 1 I felt like I flat out disagreed with. That's pretty good.
  <!-- This approach, the Hamiltonian approach, rather than the Newtonian approach, was awesome, it allowed you to immediately find equilibrium points, made numerical methods easier when exact solutions were impossible, just, just fantastic all around because they were physically identical, but Hamiltonians were mathematically much easier to work with. And then Planck, Einstein, Schroedinger and all those other early 1900's physicists screwed it all up with showing that quantum mechanics, was, in fact, a thing. The problem being that now all of a sudden the Newtonian approach didn't even make sense anymore. You can't have F=MA if A no longer meaningfully exists. The Hamiltonian approach, however, /did/ still work, because at no point did it assume things existed in particular places, just that they had known energies. At this point in your career, you start to realize that force is just something that exists in the classical limit and as such is just a kind of convenient fiction. -->

  But what about the other 3? 16 statements for CS, 15 for CR and 16 for AR. Going over them I get 35 agreements, 8 disagreements, and 4 ambiguous! So I am more probably AS than any of them at random, but a lot of the statements seemed like kind of vacuous platitudes, like, "likes to maintain friendly relationships". People that dislike friends aren't a special learning category, they're misanthropes. That Said, I will respect the spirit of the exercise. The design work does fall under the category of sentimental thinking in my book, and I did chafe under it, coupled with the time constraints my poor planning left me with it was the most problematic  of the 3 weeks. Of course with something this subjective finding causal linkages is a mugs game, but hey, those are the observations.
  <!--
  cs +4,+4, 1~ 1- 1+, 1+ 1+ 1- 1- 1-,   11+, 4- 1~
  cr +4 +3, 1- 1+ 1- 1+ 1~ 1- 1- 1+,    10+, 4- 1~
  ar +4,+4, 1+ 1~ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1~ 14+ 2~
   -->
  <!-- Now that's fine for most people, Force, Energy, God, these are just words that they hear and don't really actually care about. They don't interact with them, they don't think that hard about them, they just know that someone else has thought about them really hard and they hear it from time to time. But what about time? That is something most people care a great deal about. You can measure it quite precisely, in fact, almost as precisely as anything we can measure. You never have enough of it, you worry about it running out. What if it doesn't actually exist though? What if time is like force? -->

  The dynamic-static dichotomy is very much part of why I find 2 bits (a single base-pair of DNA!) insufficient information to describe significantly how someone learns. How do you categorize someone with a mix between those 4 states? Knowing that Truth with a capital T is elusive and fleeting, and deciding it is all the more precious for that gets you a pretty solid leg up on learning. Anyone with a modest appreciation for history can see that things are learnable, and it comes down to how hard are they willing to hike, and how good of a guide do they have for the schlep up the mountain.
<!-- That's the troubling bit, some theorists are working with physics that doesn't make use of time the same way Hamilton did away with force, and they aren't getting nonsense answers. They're making headway. -->
