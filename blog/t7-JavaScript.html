      <h2> A Hash is a Dictionary is an Object</h2>

<!-- ruby hashes are things where you can have arbitrary addresses to data rather than indices, javascript objects can have arbitrary address, and arbitrary contents, so data or functions. -->
<p>
At first blush a ruby hash and a Javascript object look very similar, you can start both the same way, hash = {}, object ={}. You can assign things very similarly, hash[key]= value, object.key= value, and even access things very similarly. "puts hash[key]" and "console.log(object.key);" will return very similar things to the console.
</p>

<p>
Unless value was complicated. Value in a hash is much more constrained than in an object. Hashes in Ruby behave much like dictionaries in python, but object's in javascript are more like the classes both of the previous languages possess.
</p>

<p>
Javascript objects constructed like they are just glorified hashes are like single-instance classes. You need to build a constructor function, which, structurally, is very similar to a class definition, before you, apropriately, get the same kind of generalization and repeatability as ruby objects.
