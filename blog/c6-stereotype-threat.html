      <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <h3>Representing our Tribes</h3>
    </a>
    <p class= "date_tag">02014-12-07 </p>

<p>
A Stereotype threat is a threat that could personally reinforce a negative stereotype. Examples of such stereotypes include women having poor quantitative reasoning skills, African Americans having poor impulse control, or Scientists having poor social graces.
</p>

<p>
Why are situations that threaten to reinforce these stereotypes important? Primarily because, curiously, things that reinforce limitations on your tribe are more stressful to individuals than things that indicate personal limitations. Why that particularly is the case is up to speculation, and I have a few hypothesies why it might be, but that's neither here nor there. The important thing is, if someone percieves a stereotype threat, it is much more anxiety inducing, their amygdala (the lizard part of your brain that is awful and just, just no fun. Literally, no fun thoughts or emotions occur there.) goes bananas and any kind of cognitively demanding task goes much worse. The problem is everything that makes us as a species is a cognitive task.
</p>

<p>
It's difficult talking about personal experiences in this regard, partially because, to all outward appearances, I'm on easy mode for the US. Talking about being oppressed or stereotyped is met with a fair bit of incredulity. The closest thing that comes to it that is personally challenging is the fact that scientists are regarded somewhere between wastes of resources to majestic, but impractical, and uniformly a- or anti-social. Trying to engage in conversation about anything other than a technical subject is usually met with a certain amount of derision and marginalization. The only way I can really get around it is by only pushing a matter when I can turn it into a technical matter. When I can reformulate into something where math is relevant and then point at it and show, yes, this is how the thing works, it's worth noticing!
</p>

<p>
Helping other people who are facing one such threat, when they trust your judgement to some extent, is trying to pull them out of their tribal identity and tell them regardless of all the social balleyhoo, they as an individual are capable of this thing they are confronted with.
