So when we have an array, or hash, or some other collection of data bundled together into the same object, we have usually bundled it because they share some common attribute. In the course of things, maybe you want to do the same thing to all these objects. Maybe we're moving a batch from waiting to resolved, or a bunch of dates from one format to another.

Enter the Map method. Much as it's mathematical counterpart, if you take some enummerable, say, list, and call the map method on it, you do a transform on each element in that list. For example, longer_list = list.map {|obj| obj*2} will populate longer_list with whatever the objects in list are when they are doubled. Maybe they were numbers, maybe they were strings? Plan in advance, because if you try to feed a string to, say, obj/2, well. Things go poorly.

  In python if you could construe your iteration method as a map, it would tuck into C really briefly and execute it very quickly. I've yet to experiment with map to see if it offers similar speed upgrades, but I wouldn't be surprised if, performance wise, it was much better than other iteration methods like array.each.
