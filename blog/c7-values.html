Cooperation is really important to me. From a very early age I realized how peculiar the societies we live in are compared to the rest of the universe. I need walk no more than 10 meters to get to a little metal protrusion hooked up by someone I'll never meet that when I fiddle with for a fraction of a second, will rapidly pour out more water than I'll need for a week. And this water has an astonishingly low chance of giving me any kind of disease, because other people I'll never meet have set up implementations of chemical operations to clean it, chemical operations developed by yet more people neither I, nor any of the previously mentioned people, will ever meet. All of society is held up by explicit and implicit cooperation. Humans are not the biggest threat to their own existence, humans are the only reason they might survive long enough to complain about being cut off in traffic.

I think I tend to edit out the times I was actually useful, that or I don't get asked for advice very often. The two that come to mind are when a first year asked for help on a linear algebra assignment, and it invoked a concept that I have <strong>never</strong> seen used in physics, so I was no use there, and another when what I must assume was a new faculty member asked how to use the coffee machine in the lounge, wherein I gave a quick demonstration which hopefully resolved everything clearly.

Scientists are rarely esteemed for their compassion or affection, their courage, or even their creativity. It changes from time to time and person to person, but scientists are very much one of the Others that people tend to lump into some box that describes that entire person, and when things happen outside that box, it is remarked on as odd, and then ignored. These stereotypes can hurt and I don't know if being aware of stereotype threats is helping, I've only had a week to meditate on and experience them. I'm hoping that it's useful, but there are lots of pyschological problems that are easy to spot, but hard to over power.
