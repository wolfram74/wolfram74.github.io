So organizing code is kind broken up into 3 major camps, blocks, procedures (procs), and lambdas.
</p>

<p>
we'll start with blocks first as they are kind of the primordial form, and the other two are ways of handling them. So, a block is, rather reasonably, a block of code. It's nice when it's all straight forward like that, isn't it? It's a small piece, like say, the working parts of an iteration loop. A single line might be referenced as {|a| a*2}, for taking some quantity, and doubling it.
</p>

<p>
procs and lambdas are both ways of storing blocks for reuse. Saying you have block, and you find it keeps getting reused, it may be tempting to make a proc, stuff = Proc.new {block in question}. Now stuff() can be a filler for whenever you were using the block. Lambda's are similar in that they can be passed around, but one difference is that they do not end method you were in when they are invoked.
