A question well formed is most of the work in itself. Once that's happened things tend to fall into place. If you're having trouble answering a question, it's more often than not because it's being asked poorly, rather than it is intrinsically hard or universally unsolved. So what makes a question about programming well formed?
</p>

<p>
I've usually had two kinds of questions, the first kind is I'm trying to do something and it's not working, empirical questions or syntax oriented, and the second something is working but I'm trying to understand better why it works and how it would work in different contexts, more theoretical.
</p>

<p>
In both cases trying to consolidate code as tidily possible helps put it into a text-dump page to share with people and pulls into frame and clarifies to yourself what it is you're trying to accomplish. To further simplify matters it is also good to put a small comment around the particular trouble spot. Because you should figure out how to narrow down your question to a relatively small part of the code you share. Trying to fix more than one thing at a time is super hard. Now, it's entirely possible that the problem you think you have is not actually what's wrong, but this kind of disconnect is easier to find when you've explicitly stated what you think is the problem or point of contention.
</p>

<p>
So once you've prepared your question, you can post it to stack overflow, or trundle into some seedy IRC channel and start the dialog. And it will help if it's a dialog, because if something is going wrong it's going to take adjusting your preconceptions about the problem to match what's going on. Maybe you present enough information in the first asking to make it work, and the answerer will be able to provide exactly what you need to fix it. But that is unlikely, so maintain the dialog until you're on a good track.
