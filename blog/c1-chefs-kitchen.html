After watching Shereef's fireside chat, I find some of the attitudes to be parallel with how some grad students see PhD programs, they've finished having to worry about getting accepted to programs and just start focusing on participating with the rest of the scientiffic community and trying to learn and discover. The immersion level is somewhat similar, only we'll only be cloistered in the DBC environment for a few months, rather than years or decades.
</p>

<p>

This similarity is reflected in the fact that thinking of it as a standard market-driven service will leave a boot greatly unsatisfied. I mean, any time learning is involved, it's hard to get the same kind of fluid exchange of goods and services as in exchanges like cash for ipods or cash for cleaned kitchens. Knowledge is in the category of "things" that can't actually be given. You can pay for an environment conducive to learning, but you can't buy the knowledge outright (caveat allowed for speculative brain-computer interfaces). So once in that environment it still takes a personal effort to get anything out of it.
</p>
<p>

I look forward to pushing myself and hope I can help my class mates with my unusual perspective, and hope that I can collaborate effectively.</p>
