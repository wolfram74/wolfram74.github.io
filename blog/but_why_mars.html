  A few nights ago I went out into the farm fields of Iowa to get a dark enough sky to look at NEOWISE. Looking at a 5 kilometer wide ball of ice so close got me thinking about somethings. We're in the midst of a space renaissance and the idea of humans going out and space faring is more attainable than ever before. New vistas and opportunities unlike anything we'd ever have on Earth seem to be just over the horizon. So why does it feel like so many people are obsessed with Mars?
</p>

<p>
  This may be slightly correlated with one of the flashiest figures in the space, Elon Musk and how Mars is his cause célèbre, but he's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/5-undeniable-reasons-why-humans-should-go-to-mars-2015-4"> far from alone</a>. A couple of arguments get brought up by different people. Economic opportunity of a new planet, increasing the durability of the human race, inexorable allure of exploration, development of new technologies, bragging rights, they all make the list depending on who you ask. I'm feeling like pursuing <em>any</em> of these goals with settling Mars is a failure of imagination.

<h4>Economic Opportunity</h4>

<p>
  An economic opportunity is, in almost all cases, a situation where you have some comparative advantage over other participants in the market. This could be any kind of thing. A few examples might be a physical resource like coal being more easily accessible. Or technological like having better handle on steel working, allowing you to use the resource more efficiently. Or it might be sociological like having fewer stigmas about what kinds of people can work, making your community appealing to ambitious people being oppressed in other regions.
