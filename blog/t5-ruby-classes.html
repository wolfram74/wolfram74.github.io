So one of the defining features of Ruby as a language is that it is object oriented. This means all of its operations are somehow construted as objects interacting with each other. This is a useful design paradigm for programs that might be used in unexpected or very broad ways. You can capture intended uses into just the methods that exist.
</p>

<p>
I have included a simple example of a class of objects. It crudely models the behavior of a guitar fretboard. It can be found
<a href="../fret.rb"> here</a>. At the moment it has two major functionalities, drawing on major scales, and printing out the result. The class is initiated by calling object1 = FretBoard.new() and from there you can print an adorned board. But maybe you'd like to see what frets are associated with the c-major scale, you could call object1.place_scale("c",0). This would prime the board so it's marked with the notes for the c-major scale, and we could see it when we print it with object1.print_kneck.
</p>

<p>
This is nice, but maybe we want to compare the c scale, to d-sharp? well, sharps are noted with capitals. So we could make a second scale, object2= Fretboard.new(), object2.place_scale("D",0) and object2.print_kneck. Now it's printed out a seperate instance of the kneck. This is handy because we've stored two different states of a similar thing. This is part of the purpose of objects, is that they all fit in some broad category, but are variations of each other.
