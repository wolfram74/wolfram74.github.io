There are a lot of problems in the technology and programming world. Wealth inequality, iminent bubble bursting, minority participation. There's a lot of them. But I'm gonna be kind of broad.
</p>
 -->

<!-- <p>
Where to start on the laundry list of problems in the tech community? Abusive work cycles? Bandwagon effect? Impostor syndrome? Clustering Illusion? So, I think I could talk about a particular problem that aflicts programmers, namely when clients fail to actually ask for something and then complain when they don't get what they want, or I could talk about absurd monetization and how it's leading to myopia and another bubble bursting.
</p>

<p>
Since the money topic is something both sides of the keyboard are guilty of, lets talk about that a little. Earlier this year, a program called Yo was valued at over 10 million dollars. It got 1.5 million dollars of capital to work on expanding it. The deliverable functionality at the time was nothing more than pinging a human. It would pop up a little alert, no content or informational payload, just a small constant flag.
</p>

<p>
So this is kind of goddamned ridiculous. You could build a school with that kind of money. and the stupid thing doesn't actually do anything email doesn't already do. But this a result when investors have large stacks of cash and no projects that will result in returns in 6 months. So many honestly transformative things will take 10, 20 or 40 years.
</p>


<p>
How does this impact grunts and the rest of the labor force?
</p>

<p>
In asking us to talk about issues about the tech industry, you are somewhat asking us to paint ourselves into corners, because we've no first hand experience about it. It's like asking patients of doctors what's wrong with doctors. They see the service, but not the minimum of 10 years that goes into making the doctor. But! I will endeavor to put forth something reasonable.
</p>

<p>
What I'm thinking of is not a problem unique to tech, but it is particularly noticeable in it's hiring practices and design philosophies. It's been somewhat more formally enshrined that in other communities. I'm  going to talk about context insensitive time myopia (CIMT). A term I just cobbled together because English is an open source language, deal with it.
</p>

<p>
Myopia is medical term associated with nearsightedness, typically pathological. Time myopia is a term I am associating with ignoring both the past and the future and giving overwhelming or exclusive attention to the present. Context insensitivity is when a given state is a constant, regardless of outside influences or objectives.
</p>

<p>
It's the context insensitivity in CIMT that makes it a problem. When you are cooking dinner, you need to be focusing on the present, are things on fire, what's going in the pot next, where's knife. All that stuff. But what about shortly before you go grocery shopping? Now you need to expand your time sense. The future is important, what do you want to eat? How often will you be cooking vs eating out? Does your schedule require simpler meals or do you have the option to embellish? CIMT prevents you from transitioning from planning phase to implementation phase.
</p>

<p>
Phrased that way it might be more obvious. When in implementation it's all about Now, agile development enshrines Now. Do the bare minimum that is defined in specs, don't think to the future of how this might be used or misused, don't think about what came before, just knuckle down and push it out the door.
</p>

<p>
Thinking in multiple time scales is hard though. And even the disciplines where it's required, the skill doesn't always percolate out from where it's necessary to merely useful. So I don't know how you can make people learn to think of the past as a valid source of information or the future as a place they will eventually have to survive.
