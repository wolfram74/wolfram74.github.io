    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A web page is constructed of HTML (hypertext markup language) which informs the browser how information and content is related to each other. Beyond a basic level, it's appearance is governed by CSS (cascading style sheets) which can produce a bewildering array of visual effects. This exercise provides you with a design object (the <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway webpage</a>) and 2 different starting points for HTML. Both have been stripped of their meaning. Go over the readme in the project for more details.
