    <h1>From 0 to Basic Games</h1>
    <h3>Fundamental Javascript skills to make games</h2>
    <h2>Over View</h2>
    <p>
      It is a common desire to make games, after all, playing games is one of the fundamental things humans do, and a game has to be invented before it can be played. People do it with friends all the time, while bored in the car or with a deck of cards. The rules are explained briefly and everybody just kind of runs with it. Computers are kind pretty bad at ambiguity though, so to make a game that a computer can run for people and take care of all the details, we have to be very explicit about what's going on. This is explicitness is handled by programming languages, we give instructions to the computer and it takes it from there. To make a game in a way that can be handled by a programming language we'll need to start breaking games down into more basic parts and figure out what skills allow us to deal with those parts. Now as a caveat, games are a pretty wide area of human thought, so any set of criteria specific enough to be a useful starting point is also likely going to be so specific as to rule some things out that are often referred to as games. Finding the short coming in basic descriptions is what we do after our skills have grown past the basics, so we'll put those details aside for now.

    <h2>
      Components of a Game.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following broad components make up games and using the classic game pong to provide an example.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            <b>STATE</b>: a collection of information
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <b>MECHANICS</b>: a collection of rules that dictate how STATE changes
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <b>CONTROLS</b>: a collection of methods for a user to change STATE
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <b>INTERFACE</b>: a means for a user or player to get feedback on what the STATE is
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      In Pong, the location of the ball and the players' paddles, the score of the players, this makes up the STATE of the game. The fact that the ball bounces off the walls and paddles, that a player score increases when the ball gets behind another players paddle, these are MECHANICS. That the players can move the paddles by key presses or moving the mouse are CONTROLS. The visual representation of where the paddles and the ball is the INTERFACE. Interface and graphics are often interchangeable, but not necessarily, many early games had a purely text based interface, so it is important understand that STATE and INTERFACE are different parts of a game.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic Skills related to STATE</h2>
    <p>
      State in a computer program is data stored in variables. A given piece of data is of a particular type, different languages support different types by default. Javascript's basic types include Number, String, Boolean, Array and Object.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            Numbers you are most likely familiar with, things like 1, 4.3, -27.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
           Strings are any collection of letters and characters, denoted as being between single or double quotes, 'one string', "another string"
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Booleans are just true and false, but they are used in for many parts of program flow.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Arrays are ordered collections of other kinds of data, like several numbers, several strings, or mixtures of both.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            Objects are labeled collections of other kinds of data, a number labeled age and a string labeled name that are associated together, for example.
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <h2>Advance Skills related to STATE</h2>
      It is common that in making a game, some things occur multiple times. Take, for example, a Goomba in mario brothers. Each goomba would have the same kinds of state, but different values. Javascript allows you to, in effect, make your own data types. Creating your own data types involves writing a constructor function and running it prefixed with the 'new' keyword. It is a nuanced subject for people new to programming, but allows you to make your code much easier to conceptualize and work with. These datatypes you define are sometimes referred to as prototypes.

      <h2>Basic skills related to MECHANICS</h2>
      Mechanics describe how a game responds to different circumstances, if mario runs into a turtle from the side, he takes damage, if he falls from the top the turtle is knocked out of it's shell. If Kerrigan tries to cast psionic storm with enough energy, she succeeds, loses some energy and enemies lose health, otherwise she fails and nothing happens. These are explicit rules about how state changes. In Javascript, functions are collections of code that modify or create data. They are run( or called) with input data (or arguments). One simple example of a function is from the Math library, Math.pow(2, 3) returns the number 8, because that's 2 to the 3rd power. You can write your own functions to do almost anything. The simplest decisions that happen in functions are like I described with Kerrigan, something is checked to be either true or false. If true, a thing happens. This is called an if-statement. If you wanted something else to happen, you would follow it with an else-statement.

    <p>
      <h2>Advanced skills related to MECHANICS</h2>
      Functions that accomplish particular abstract goals are sometimes referred to as algorithms. For example, if you had many different players, but wanted to order them based on score, you would use a sorting algorithm to order them. If you had a non-player character decide it's own path through a map, it would use a path finding algorithm. Learning about algorithm design will help you to make complicated mechanics in games.
      <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup">Hacker Rank</a> has a large collection of challenges set up for lots of different languages, and it checks your answer for correctness with automated testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automated testing is an important part of making more complicated programs. Proving that a function does the correct thing for all inputs is a difficult exercise in formal proofs, if it's possible at all. Fortunately it's often  comparitively easy to imagine one or two cases, figure out by hand what the results should be and then compare those against the results of what you've programmed. When you set up a program to do these comparisons for you automatically, this is called automated testing. When you think of test cases before you've written your functions, this is called test driven development, and usually leads to more understandable code.

      Finally, the passage of time in the game system is often an important consideration. If you're playing the game 60 frames per second, then every frame, the screen might change, but more importantly, the location of enemies might change. SetTimeout and SetInterval are the built in methods for dealing with executing functions based on time like this. SetInterval is easier to implement, but SetTimeout is more flexible and safer.

      <h2>Basic skills related to CONTROLS</h2>
      The web browser makes handling userinput considerably easier than most other languages. It's constantly listening for input already, and javascript allows you to observe or listen to this input and have functions respond to it. The simplest kind of input might be clicking on a button. This is relatively straight forward, and could be used to mimic the effects of a menu in some turn based games. A slightly more complicated listener would be to do things based on keyboard presses. This is slightly more complicated because if you wanted to do one thing if the 'w' key was pressed, and a different thing if 's' key was pressed, you'd have to have a piece of your program distinguish between those two values. This is a small increase in complexity, but entirely surmountable with if statements or a number of other options.

    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Advanced skills related to CONTROLS</h2>
      Clicking on discrete elements of a web page or listening to key presses are relatively straight forward because there is only a very limited range of things that you might be comparing. making decisions on mouse position and movement is potentially much more complicated as the mouse can be anywhere on the screen, moving in any number of ways, clicking or dragging any number of things. Implementing good controls that make use of this versatility is a taller order than for simply handling key presses.

    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Basic skills related to INTERFACE</h2>
      The easiest form of interface you can make is a textual description of state, take for example in older turn based games where a portion of the screen was just a collection of numbers corresponding to health and energy levels. Even many modern games take this approach for some information, like rounds of ammunition in shooters. The recent game Papers, Please was incredibly evocative even though a great deal of it's information was conveyed through text. Javascript was initially made for manipulating web pages, which makes text modification fairly straightforward.

    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Advanced skills related to INTERFACE</h2>
      With the dawn of HTML5, the canvas element was introduced. The canvas makes implementing graphical interfaces much easier. This ranges from basic shapes like
      <a href="http://wolfram74.github.io/perfect_shuffle.html">lines</a> or rectangles and
      <a href="http://wolfram74.github.io/canvas_play.html">direct pixel editing</a>, to more advanced techniques like <a href="http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-sprite-animation/">sprite manipulation.</a>
